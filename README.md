## Thanks for visiting! 
This repository is meant to be both a portfolio and a portfolio piece in and of itself.

The `backend/` directory includes the API for the tictactoe game. For those of you who are familiar with NextJS, you may be asking a simple question:
'Why'd you deploy a container on Google Cloud instead of just using an api folder in your project itself?'

The answer's just as simple. I wanted to learn more about using cloud infrastructure and deploying containers. I could easily write the API in my NextJS project in Typescript and call it a day (hell, I still might), but the reason I decided to write my entire portfolio from scratch was so that I could learn without boundaries. I hope that comes across.

The `website/` submodule includes a (hopefully) up-to-date copy of the site's source code. I wanted this repo to have a full picture of the project, including the API and commit history, without complicating the repo that my Vercel deployment is on. If you're unsure on the development of the actual preview branch, you can consult the [website repo](https://github.com/theonlynanu/website) - that should have the most recent version of the site's deployment, including the preview branch and its tests.

Finally, you might notice that the git commits are, for lack of a better word, insane. Very *very* granular, with some interstitial commits that aren't quite functional or meaningful. The reason for this is threefold. 

First, I wanted to show the thinking I had going through the development of this site, and I can't think of a better way than showing each change I made in the order I did. As a portfolio piece, I think the overkill is worthwhile.

Second, I wanted to test different version control flows - I ended up on something that is basically Github Flow, but I wanted to be able to *feel* the differences before choosing one, rather than just going with whatever other people said they like. Now, if I am part of a team that works differently, I won't feel out of the water, and I'm comfortable enough with Git to work in different ways.

Third, I was learning a lot during this project. I wanted a comprehensive history to look back on, as well as a healthy amount of rollback space if something broke. I used some experimental tools and a lot of new technologies, and having this as both a project to show off *and* a project to look back on is, frankly, priceless.

I hope you enjoyed your time here. If you'd like to reach out to me, feel free to do so at danyalsmail@gmail.com, and if you see any fixes I should make, please feel free to make a pull request. I'd love to meet new people and talk to other devs about both my projects and theirs. Thanks for your time!
